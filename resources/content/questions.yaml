- question: What problem do you try to solve?
  answer:
    <p>Integrating APIs from external services into your app is still a complicated and time consuming task since every
    company provides its own SDK which has specific behaviours and often SDKs are not available in the fitting programming
    language, in this case we mostly rely on SDKs which are developed by the community, which can become quickly outdated
    or unmaintained.</p>
    <p>The SDK Fabric project tries to solve this by providing an open infrastructure to automatically generate SDKs for
    every API. This means to build an SDK you only need to describe the API at the TypeHub platform and based on this we
    generate a fitting SDK for each supported programming language and also submit the SDK to each package manager.
    TypeHub provides an visual editor so that also non-developers can help to build the SDK.</p>
- question: Why is my programming language not supported?
  answer:
    <p>Our roadmap contains adding C# and Python as supported programming language. Please let us know what programming
    language you would like to see next.</p>
- question: How can I add a new SDK?
  answer:
    <p>Please use our <a href="https://www.apioo.de/en/contact">contact form</a> to suggest a new API. To speed up the
    process you can also create a specification at <a href="https://typehub.cloud/">TypeHub</a> which describes
    the API, then we can directly use this specification as starting point.</p>
- question: How can I support this project?
  answer:
    <p>At first the best way to support the project is by simply using and star the SDKs which we manage. Then it also
    really helps if you add missing operations or types to the <a href="https://app.typehub.cloud/d/sdkfabric">specifications</a>
    managed at <a href="https://typehub.cloud/">TypeHub</a>. If you want to financially support our project please take
    a look at our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chriskapp">GitHub sponsoring</a>.</p>
- question: How can my company use this service?
  answer:
    <p>Currently there is no direct way to use our service since in the first step we only try to manage popular SDKs to
    gain visibility. But please <a href="https://www.apioo.de/en/contact">contact us</a> if you are interested in
    using our service for your company API so that we know that there is a demand for such a service.</p>
- question: I have found a problem in the generated SDK?
  answer:
    <p>If you have found a problem in the generated SDK please create an issue directly at our
    <a href="https://github.com/sdk-fabric/website">GitHub repository</a>. For private topics you can also use our
    <a href="https://www.apioo.de/en/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
