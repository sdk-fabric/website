- question: What is the difference to BaaS provider like Firebase, Supabase, etc.?
  answer:
    <p>In contrast to most Backend-as-a-Service providers APIgen uses a generative approach, this means instead fo defining
    your data structure through a backend you define the data structure at our generator. Then we generate based on this
    data structure a complete API tailored to your use case which you can use to CRUD those entities. This has also the
    great advantage, that you can easily customize every endpoint to your needs.</p>
- question: How much does this service cost?
  answer:
    <p>Our service is free, you only need to register an account in order to use our generator. For power users there is
    also an option to obtain a basic or pro plan which allows you to create more projects. Fusio is open-source (Apache2),
    please consider a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chriskapp">donation</a> if you want to support our project.</p>
