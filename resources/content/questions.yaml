- question: What problem do you try to solve?
  answer:
    <p>Integrating APIs from external services into your app is still a complicated and time consuming task since every
    company provides its own SDK which has a specific behaviour and often SDKs are not available in the needed programming
    language, in this case we mostly rely on SDKs which are developed by the community, which can become quickly outdated
    or unmaintained.</p>
    <p>The SDK Fabric project tries to solve this problem by providing an open infrastructure to automatically generate
    SDKs for every API. This means to build an SDK you only need to describe the API at the TypeHub platform and based
    on this we generate a fitting SDK for each supported programming language and also submit the SDK to each package
    manager. TypeHub provides an visual editor so that also non-developers can help to build and improve the SDK.</p>
- question: Why is my programming language not supported?
  answer:
    <p>Currently we focus on the 6 supported major programming languages C#, Go, Java, Javascript, PHP and Python. If
    there is huge demand for another language we are of course open to extend our generator.</p>
- question: How can I support this project?
  answer:
    <p>At first the best way to support the project is by simply using and star the SDKs which we manage. Then it also
    really helps if you add missing operations or types to the <a href="https://app.typehub.cloud/d/sdkfabric">specifications</a>
    managed at <a href="https://typehub.cloud/">TypeHub</a>. If you want to financially support our project please take
    a look at our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/chriskapp">GitHub sponsoring</a>.</p>
- question: How can my company use this service?
  answer:
    <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://sdk-fabric.org/submit">Submit</a> page to see how you can submit your
    specification. Also feel free to <a href="https://www.apioo.de/en/contact">contact us</a> if you are interested in
    using our service for your company API so that we know that there is a demand for such a service.</p>
- question: I have found a problem in the generated SDK?
  answer:
    <p>If you have found a problem in the generated SDK please create an issue directly at our
    <a href="https://github.com/sdk-fabric/website">GitHub repository</a>. For private topics you can also use our
    <a href="https://www.apioo.de/en/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
- question: Can we work together?
  answer:
    <p>Our project is currently in an early stage, please <a href="https://www.apioo.de/en/contact">contact us</a> if
    you have ideas to work and grow with us.</p>
